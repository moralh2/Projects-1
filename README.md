In our frst project, we decided to pull data from a few API's to create an brewery info and locator app. The biggest challenge was running into CORS authentication issues. We chose to store some data from an API on firebase temporarily to overcome this. We made our pages simple wiith google maps, breweryDB, and wikipedia APIs. All this data quickly shows users the "where" and "what" on their neighborhood Austin breweries.
